# Beagle — Clinical Cockpit for MedLang (Skeleton)

Beagle is the reference application for MedLang:

- UI for editing MedLang protocols and models
- Orchestrating simulations and training
- Displaying trajectories, distributions, fractal metrics, risk curves
- Auditing runs (inputs, seeds, outputs, versions)

Status: placeholder. First goal is to have working MedLang core + runtime,
then build Beagle on top.
